Hello!

My name is Payam and I am a data engineer analyst. My interests and expertise include creating Shiny dashboards and other BI tools, cleaning and validating data, setting up pipelines, and making analytical reports. I work in a clinical setting and primarily use R.

On my free time, I enjoy reading, working out, and playing with my cat.

For my complete resume, please reach out to me at `hello@pymk.dev`.
