Hello!

My name is Payam and I am an analytics engineer.

My interests and expertise include creating dashboards using Shiny and other BI tools, cleaning and validating data, setting up pipelines, and making analytical reports. I work in a clinical setting and primarily use R.

On my free time, I enjoy reading, tinkering, working out, and consuming media with [my cat](./posts/my-cat/).

For my complete resume, please reach out to me at `pymkdb@gmail.com`.
