    "title": "dbt Tutorial",
    "section": "",
    "text": "We were thinking about using dbt at work to help with our data pipeline, so I thought this winter break would be a good time to learn the basics.\nThey offer two products: “dbt Cloud” and “dbt Core”. As the name suggests, “Cloud” is their subscription service and “Core” is free CLI tool.\nThey have lots of nice guides, docs, and tutorials for learning. The one I started with is their jaffle_shop dbt Core tutorial.\nOne of the prerequisites is to set up BigQuery to access the data, but for learning purposes, I just wanted to run things locally. Could not find a guide or the dataset on their official channels, but I managed to find CSV files for the tables in an old repo on Github. It was probably from their earlier version of the tutorial.\nAnyway, I created this guide to use a local Postgres dataset for the jaffle_shop tutorial.\n\nNotes:\n\nDownload the datasets from here and put them in data/ directory within the project (i.e. ~/../dbt-tutorial/jaffle_shop/data/)\nEnsure you are in the project directory (i.e. ~/../dbt-tutorial/jaffle_shop/) for running the Postgres and dbt commands\n\n\nFirst, install Postgres app.\nIn terminal, we can login to Postgres as sudo with:\npsql -U postgres\nAnd use the command \\l to list of current databases available.\nNext, we create a user and database for jaffle_shop. In my example, the user is dbt_test (password: dbt_test) and the database is called jaffle_shop.\nCREATE USER dbt_test WITH PASSWORD 'adb_test';\nCREATE DATABASE jaffle_shop WITH OWNER 'dbt_test';\nUsing \\l, we can see the new database is created. Now we can exist sudo with \\q\nNext, we login to jaffle_shop database as the new user (dbt_test) we just created:\npsql -U dbt_test jaffle_shop\nWe can use \\dt command to list all available tables (should be none right now) in this database.\nThe following commands create our tables (schema is based on the CSV files in the data/ folder).\nCREATE TABLE customers\n (id INTEGER, first_name TEXT, last_name TEXT, email TEXT);\n\nCREATE TABLE orders\n (id INTEGER, user_id INTEGER, order_date DATE, status TEXT);\n\nCREATE TABLE payments\n (id INTEGER, order_id INTEGER, payment_method TEXT, amount BigInt);\nNow we can run \\dt again to see a list of newly created tables.\nTo copy the contents of the CSV files into these tables, we use these commands:\n\\copy customers(id,first_name,last_name,email) FROM './data/raw_customers.csv' WITH DELIMITER ',' CSV header;\n\n\\copy orders(id,user_id,order_date,status) FROM './data/raw_orders.csv' WITH DELIMITER ',' CSV header;\n\n\\copy payments(id,order_id,payment_method,amount) FROM './data/raw_payments.csv' WITH DELIMITER ',' CSV header;\nAnd a quick sanity check to ensure we have the data:\nSELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY id ASC LIMIT 10;\nSELECT * FROM orders ORDER BY id ASC LIMIT 10;\nSELECT * FROM payments ORDER BY id ASC LIMIT 10;\nAnd that’s it. We can quit at anytime with \\q and continue with the tutorial.\nThe example models created for this tutorial are also in my repo for reference.\n\nThe configuration for ~/.dbt/profiles.yml looks like this:\njaffle_shop:\n  outputs:    \n    dev:\n        type: postgres\n        threads: 4\n        host: localhost\n        port: 5432\n        user: dbt_test\n        pass: dbt_test\n        dbname: jaffle_shop\n        schema: public\n  \n  target: dev"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Instead of flying, I took an 8-hour train ride from Vanna to Zurich. Was it worth it? Yup! The tickets for the first-class was still a whole lot cheaper than flying, but the main beauty of it was the scenery, especially when passing through towns like Salzburg or as you get closer to Switzerland.\nOnce I arrived, I booked another hotel near the city center to be close to the attractions. Couldn’t do anything that first day because by the time I got there, it was already 4pm and I had to login to work.\nThe second day is when I went to exploring and see museums. Found a really good coffee shop that had the most amazing smoothies.\nOriginally I wanted to stay here a few more days and go to Belgium after, but I decided not to exhaust myself. Traveling so frequently is tiring and working in the evenings until 10 P.M. isn’t ideal (I’m a morning person!).\nSo I finished this journey here and booked a flight back to the Bay Area.\nFor my next trip, I think I want to travel to different cities and states in the U.S. (already have a list!).\nBucket-list for next visit: take a train ride (or stay at) some of the other cities like Vern, Geneva, Basel, and Lucerne (Mount Pilatus)."

    "text": "I started off with Oslo. I know a lot of folks come here and enjoy the sceneries and the hikes, but I was visiting family, so didn’t do any of that. Just mainly walked around the city and saw some of its museums and art scenes.\nWe visited Oslo in 2016, so it had been a few years. They’ve built a lot of things in the city center near the water (more restaurants and attractions) and it looks very modern. Because of the time zone difference, I didn’t really eat much when we were out, and by the time the jet-lag was wearing off, we were on the plane to the next destination.\nBucket-list for next visit: go hiking and try the salmon."

    "text": "I picked Athens next because of all the historical places it has to offer. Plus, it was a quick 1.5 hour flight.\nOnce I arrived, I had to start work again (“working from home”), so I’d go out in the mornings and come back to my hotel room in the afternoons and work until bed time. I honestly didn’t think it would be this taxing to work late at night. Plus, I wear myself out in the mornings, so by the time it was work time, I was already ready to call it a day.\nUsed to work with this person who was based in Switzerland and would work in California time. She would be up until midnight and I never realized how hard that must have been. Well now I know. I don’t think it’s something I can do long-term.\nBucket-list for next visit: visit one of the Greek islands"

    "text": "So I thought to take advantage of the remote work situation and travel a bit. In the past few years, I’ve only gone to a couple of places (RStudio Conference in Washington and a visit to the Grand Canyon in Arizona).\nI don’t travel much because I find it stressful a bit. I think it’s the planning part that I find tiring. BUT that’s a minor inconvenience and no reason for staying in one place and not see the world other cultures.\nSo I have family in Norway and Turkey, so I am starting this journey there. Going from California to Oslo, then Istanbul. After that, I have the flexibility to go anywhere."

She had lived here before when she was younger, so she even spoke the language. It was like having a personal concierge!\nReally had a wonderful time going around with her and eating all the food. So many pastries! I probably gained a few pounds this past week.\nOne of my favorite things was sleeping on her couch in the living room. Her apartment was on the top floor with 270 degree view of the city, so it looked magical at nights. Going to bed with that view and waking up to it in the morning… there was nothing like it.\nBucket-list for next visit: none!"
