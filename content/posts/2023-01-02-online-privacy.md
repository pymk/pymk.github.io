Initially I was writing about how at the beginning of each year, I go through my accounts and delete my online presence for services I no longer use. But that got me thinking about the different ways I try to keep my privacy online, which might be a fun thing to jot down.

## Email Accounts

First things first, I have 4 main email accounts:

1. Personal use that I give to friends and family.
2. One that I use with important accounts that I regularly use or those have to ties to my identity (e.g. banking, insurance, utilities).
3. Professional one that I only put on my resume.
4. A catch-all for disposable online accounts (e.g. stores).

All four accounts have unique and strong, randomly generated passwords with multi-factor authentication enabled (MFA through auth app, not through SMS).

For random websites, I use email masking for each site (see [Email Masking section](#email-masking)).

## Password Manager

I use [1Password](https://1password.com) and have been very happy with it (previously used KeePass). What I really like about it is how easy it is to organize and tag different records. You can also have multiple "vaults". I have a personal one, a family one that I share with my family, one for [traveling](https://support.1password.com/travel-mode/), and one for work credentials.

It also allows you to store other things, such as MFA codes.

**Other Options:** [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/pricing/)

## Email Masking

I really like email masking feature and often use them even with my catch-all email accounts. I generate them through [Firefox Relay](https://relay.firefox.com), [iCloud](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210425), and [SimpleLogin](https://simplelogin.io).

Firefox Relay recently added [phone number masking](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/privacy-security/hide-your-phone-number-with-firefox-relay/). However, it does not work with services that reject VOIP numbers.

**Other Options:** [iCloud](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210425) | [Fastmail](https://1password.com/fastmail/) | [SimpleLogin](https://simplelogin.io)

## VPN

I also use [Mullvad VPN](https://mullvad.net), which is who [Mozilla partnered with](https://mullvad.net/en/blog/2019/12/3/mullvad-partnerships-page-has-been-updated-mozilla/) to provide their VPN service.

**Other Options:** [Mozilla VPN](https://vpn.mozilla.org/) | [Proton VPN](https://protonvpn.com)

## Browsing

I use [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) as my main browser. The only browser I am signed into with my Google account is Chrome, which is what I use to check my email or do anything related to my Google account. Outside of that, I only use Firefox.
