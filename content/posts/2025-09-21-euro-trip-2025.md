I can't believe it's been three years since my last major trip. I really need to start planning ahead... maybe plan things during the winter holidays next time?

Here's my initial itinerary for this year's European adventure. There are two versions:
1. An ambitious one, hitting 8 countries with 3-night stays
2. A more leisurely approach covering 5 countries with 5-7 days in each

It really depend on how I'm feeling when the time comes. It might be a mix of both.

Outside of my flights and the Oslo hotel, I've intentionally haven't booked anything else. This flexibility is what I love most about these trips. I like the freedom to adapt as I go.

- **Sweden**: Stockholm (3 nights)
- **Denmark:** Copenhagen (3 nights)

## Option 2: The Deep Dive
