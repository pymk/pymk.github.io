Hard to believe it's been three years since my last major trip. Like last time, I kept things spontaneous and didn't really plan anything outside of booking my flights and the Oslo hotel.

It worked okay, but for the next trip, I'll definitely plan ahead. I wanted to go to Spain (Barcelona), but could not find available hotels under $500 per night. Everything was booked!

Anyway, I had a very nice trip:

- **Norway:** Oslo (3 nights)
- **Sweden**: Malmo (1 night)
- **Denmark:** Copenhagen (7 nights)
- **Netherlands:** Amsterdam (3 nights)

Hands down, Copenhagen was the highlight of the trip for me.
