I usually spend a couple of weeks traveling or go on a road trip over the summer, but I did not do that this year. I was planning a trip to Japan, but after purchasing my tiny home a few months back, I decided to save up a bit more before going on an expensive trip. Plus, I will be attending a conference next month in Chicago, so that sort of counts.

Besides, I've been thoroughly enjoying my time by going to the gym 3-5 times a week, reading every night (finished the _Mistborn_ trilogy recently), play through my backlog of games (_Elden Ring_ is now my all-time favorite), and overall having a good time.
