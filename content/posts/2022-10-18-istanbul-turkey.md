The second destination was Istanbul. My cousin and her family (and cat!) moved here a couple of years ago, so she really knew where to take us. She had lived here before when she was younger, so she even spoke the language. It was like having a personal concierge!

Really had a wonderful time going around with her and eating all the food. So many pastries! I probably gained a few pounds this past week.

One of my favorite things was sleeping on her couch in the living room. Her apartment was on the top floor with 270 degree view of the city, so it looked magical at nights. There is nothing like going to bed with that view and waking up to it in the morning.

Bucket-list for next visit: none!
