Instead of flying, I took an 8-hour train ride from Vanna to Zurich. Was it worth it? Yup! The tickets for the first-class was still a whole lot cheaper than flying, but the main beauty of it was the scenery, especially when passing through towns like Salzburg or as you get closer to Switzerland.

Once I arrived, I booked another hotel near the city center to be close to the attractions. Couldn't do anything that first day because by the time I got there, it was already 4 P.M. and I had to login to work.

The second day is when I went to exploring and see museums. Found a really good coffee shop that had the most amazing smoothies.

Originally I wanted to stay here a few more days and go to Belgium after, but I decided not to exhaust myself. Traveling so frequently is tiring and working in the evenings until 10 P.M. isn't ideal (I'm a morning person!).

So I finished this journey here and booked a flight back to the Bay Area.

For my next trip, I think I want to travel to different cities and states in the U.S. (already have a list!).

Bucket-list for next visit: take a train ride (or stay at) some of the other cities like Vern, Geneva, Basel, and Lucerne (Mount Pilatus).
