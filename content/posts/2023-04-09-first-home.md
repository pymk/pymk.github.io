I started looking for a small place in the beginning of the year right as the rates were going up. It took a while, but I managed to find one that I liked. My offer was accepted, so over the past month, I have been going through the purchase process.

Last week, everything was completed and I was finally given the keys. I am now working with a contractor to clean it up a bit before I move in... hopefully by the end of the month.
