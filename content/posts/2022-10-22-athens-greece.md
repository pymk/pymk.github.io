I picked Athens next because of all the historical places it has to offer. Plus, it was a quick 1.5 hour flight.

Once I arrived, I had to start work again ("working from home"), so I'd go out in the mornings and come back to the hotel room in the afternoons and work until bed time. I honestly didn't think it would be this taxing to work late at night. Plus, I wear myself out in the mornings, so by the time it was work time, I was already ready for bed.

Bucket-list for next visit: visit one of the Greek islands
