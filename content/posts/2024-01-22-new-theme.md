I was running a [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) previously, writing the posts in markdown and pushing updates through Github Actions. It worked pretty well, but I decided to change it up.

Looking for a simple static site generator, I found [Zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola) that checks all the boxes: no dependencies, lightning fast, and uses markdown. It also has lots of beautiful [themes](https://www.getzola.org/themes/), but the one that really got me excited was [no-style-please](https://github.com/atgumx/no-style-please), which is what you see here, but with minor modifications.
