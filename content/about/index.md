I'm eager to deepen my data engineering skills by using modern data platforms to build ETL pipelines, tackle data transformation challenges, and create BI dashboards. I prioritize data governance, documentation, and writing simple, readable code.

On my free time, I enjoy reading, tinkering, working out, coding, and gaming.
