So I thought to take advantage of the remote work situation and travel a bit. In the past few years, I've only gone to a couple of places (RStudio Conference in Washington and a visit to the Grand Canyon in Arizona).

I don't travel much because I find it stressful a bit. I think it's the planning part that I find tiring. BUT that's a minor inconvenience and no reason for staying in one place and not see the world other cultures.

So I have family in Norway and Turkey, so I am starting this journey there. Going from California to Oslo, then Istanbul. After that, I have the flexibility to go anywhere.
