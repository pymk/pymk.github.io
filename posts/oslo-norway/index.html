<p>I started off with Oslo. I know a lot of folks come here and enjoy the sceneries and the hikes, but I was visiting family, so didn't do any of that. Just mainly walked around the city and saw some of its museums and art scenes.</p>
<p>We visited Oslo in 2016, so it had been a few years. They've built a lot of things in the city center near the water (more restaurants and attractions) and it looks very modern. Because of the time zone difference, I didn't really eat much when we were out, and by the time the jet-lag was wearing off, we were on the plane to the next destination.</p>
<p>Bucket-list for next visit: go hiking and try the salmon.</p>
