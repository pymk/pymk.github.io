I started off with Oslo. I know a lot of folks come here and enjoy the sceneries and the hikes, but I was visiting family, so didn't do any of that. Just mainly walked around the city and saw some of its museums and art scenes.

We visited Oslo in 2016, so it had been a few years. They've built a lot of things in the city center near the water (more restaurants and attractions) and it looks very modern. Because of the time zone difference, I didn't really eat much when we were out, and by the time the jet-lag was wearing off, we were on the plane to the next destination.

Bucket-list for next visit: go hiking and try the salmon.
