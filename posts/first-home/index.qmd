I started looking for a small house in the beginning of the year right as the rates were going up. It took a while, but I managed to find a place I like and placed an offer, which was accepted. Over the past month, I have been going through the purchase, which takes longer than I thought.

Finally I was given the keys last week, so I am working with a contractor to clean it up a bit before I move in (hopefully by the end of the month).
