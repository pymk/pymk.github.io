# Hello!

This repo is used to publish my site.

---

Currently, using [Zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola) with modified [no-style-please](https://github.com/atgumx/no-style-please) theme. The Github Action workflow builds and deploys the site to my Github Pages.

> [!TIP]
> If using a theme, create a symlink on `templates/` directory to get the Github Actions deployment to work. See [this post](https://github.com/shalzz/zola-deploy-action/issues/76#issuecomment-1638917318).
